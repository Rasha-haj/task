# Develop a Command-Line Application

Exercise Description
Create a console application that allows users to insert commands of various operations. The application should provide a menu for users to select from different operations, execute the chosen operation on user-provided input, and display the results. The application should continue running until the user chooses to exit.
Requirements:
1.	User Interaction:
•	Display a menu with a list of operations.
•	Prompt the user to select an operation by entering the corresponding number.
•	Prompt the user to enter an input to be analyzed.
2.	Operations:
•	Palindrome Check: Determine if the input is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
•	Lowercase Check: Check if all characters in the input string are lowercase.
•	Digit Check: Verify if all characters in the input are digits.
•	Length Check: Check if the length of the input exceeds a predefined threshold.
•	Empty Check: Check if the input string is empty.
•	Exit Program: Provide an option to exit the application gracefully.
3.	Execution:
•	Based on the user's selection, execute the corresponding operation.
•	Display the result of the operation to the user.
•	If the selected operation is not valid, inform the user and allow them to try again.
•	Continue to display the menu and prompt for input until the user selects the exit option.
4.	Error Handling:
•	Add at least one error handling to your code.
5.	Guidelines:
•	Try to make your code maintainable and generic. 
•	Keep your code clean
